    <h1>Are you wi-fi? Cause I'm totally feeling a connection.
        If I had a nickel for every time I saw someone as beautiful as you, I'd have five cents.
        I'd like to take you to the movies, but they don't let you bring in your own snacks.
        Are you Australian? Because you meet all of my koalafications.
        Know what's on the menu? Me-N-U.
        Your middle name must be Gillette. Because you're the best a man can get!
        You look so familiar. Didn't we take a class together? I could've sworn we had chemistry.
        You and I are like nachos with jalape√±os. I'm super cheesy, you're super hot, and we belong together.
        Knock-knock. (Who's there?) When where? (When where who?) Tomorrow night, my house, you.
        Do you like Star Wars? Cause Yoda only one for me.
        Go ahead, feel my shirt. It's made of boyfriend material!
        If you were a Transformer you'd be Optimus Fine!
        Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I walk past you again?</h1>
